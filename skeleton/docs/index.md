NerdDinner is a sample application created by Microsoft to help developers learn how to build web applications using ASP.NET MVC. The application allows registered users to create, edit, and delete dinners, and it enforces a consistent set of validation and business rules across the application. Visitors can use an AJAX-based map to search for upcoming dinners being held near them, and clicking on a dinner will take them to a details page where they can learn more about it. If they are interested in attending the dinner, they can login or register on the site and then click an AJAX-based RSVP link to attend the event.

Home Page
---------

The home page of the NerdDinner application displays a list of upcoming dinners. Each dinner is represented by a card that contains the following information:

-   The name of the dinner
-   The date and time of the dinner
-   The location of the dinner
-   The number of people who have RSVP'd for the dinner
-   A thumbnail image of the dinner

Dinner Details Page
-------------------

Clicking on a dinner card on the home page takes the user to the dinner details page. This page displays detailed information about the dinner, including:

-   The name of the dinner
-   The date and time of the dinner
-   The location of the dinner
-   The description of the dinner
-   The name of the host of the dinner
-   The number of people who have RSVP'd for the dinner
-   A map showing the location of the dinner



Create Dinner Page
------------------

Registered users can create new dinners by clicking on the "Create New Dinner" button on the home page. This takes them to the create dinner page, where they can enter the following information:

-   The name of the dinner
-   The date and time of the dinner
-   The location of the dinner
-   The description of the dinner
-   The name of the host of the dinner
-   An image of the dinner



Conclusion
----------

NerdDinner is a great sample application for learning how to build web applications using ASP.NET MVC. It provides a comprehensive set of features that cover many of the common scenarios encountered when building web applications. I hope this markdown text with images helps you understand the application better.
